##1. Get EVS data. The data you want is ZA7500. You can find it here: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7500 (10%)
I made a research account under my UMD email, smcnair1@umd.edu to download the data. I downloaded the SPSS version of the data, and stored it in the folder I will be working out of for this assignment.

##2. Write an overall report as a pdf.
#• clean data for analysis (20%)
#• descriptive tables, graphs and regression tables (20%)
#• two version of the report, one showing no R code (for policy makers) and one that also shows your code (for statisticians) (10%)

##3. Country level automated report in html.
